  <p>Ball pythons are known for their docile nature and manageable size, making them a popular choice for reptile
    enthusiasts. They come in a variety of morphs, which are different color and pattern variations. Some popular morphs
    include the albino, piebald, and pastel ball pythons.</p>
  <p>When setting up a habitat for your ball python, it's important to maintain proper temperature and humidity levels.
    The warm side of the enclosure should be around 88-92°F, while the cool side should be around 78-80°F. Humidity
    levels should be kept between 50-60% to ensure proper shedding and overall health.</p>
