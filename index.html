  <p>Ball pythons are known for their docile nature and manageable size, making them a popular choice for reptile enthusiasts. They come in a variety of morphs, which are different color and pattern variations. Some popular morphs include the albino, piebald, and pastel ball pythons.</p>
  <p>When setting up a habitat for your ball python, it's important to maintain proper temperature and humidity levels. The warm side of the enclosure should be around 88-92°F, while the cool side should be around 78-80°F. Humidity levels should be kept between 50-60% to ensure proper shedding and overall health.</p>
