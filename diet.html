    <h1>Diet</h1>
    <p>Another aspect of owning a ball python (and any other animal for that matter) is feeding it. Ball pythons eat
        usually every week or two (ask a vet or previous caretaker about this).</p>
    <p>These types of snakes eat either mice or rats. The food they eat should be no larger than the largest part of
        their body.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Something that some snake owners do is put the snake into a separate enclosure for eating. Personally, I don't do
        that because it can scare the snake and make it feel uncomfortable (and therefore not eat).</p>

    </div>
    <p>
        Ball pythons are also known for being very picky eaters, only eating when the food is at the right temperature
        and how old it is, etc. My snake however, is not too picky.
